# SI370_BaseBallAnalysis

My final course project for SI370: Data Exploration

The goal of the course project was select a data set, do exploratory data analysis, and then with some research questions in mind use the data to answer those questions. 

The data set I choose can be found on Sean Lahman’s website: http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/. Using the data set I looked to answer the following questions:

**Question 1** What is the distribution of weight in the MLB? 

**Question 2** Have players’ weight increased over time?

**Question 3** Can we classify players’ position by weight?

**Question 4** Can we predict team wins from their run differential?

**Question 5** Do teams with higher payrolls win more world series?

For the code used to answer the following questions please look at **FinalReportAnalysis-Vivianah.ipynb**. 

For a detailed explaination of results and what methods were used please look at **MLB_Exploratory_Analysis.pdf** for a detailed report.
